# Tree Pathfinding

This project implements a tree structure and a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path from the root to specified target nodes based on heuristic values.

## Features

- **Tree Structure**: Built using a custom `TreeNode` class with random heuristic (`h(n)`) and cost (`g(n)`) values.
- **Pathfinding**: Utilizes a simple frontier-based search to find the shortest path to designated target nodes.

## Installation

No external dependencies are required. This project is written in Python and can be run in any standard Python environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/tree_pathfinding.git
   cd tree_pathfinding
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Output

The program will display the structure of the tree and the shortest path(s) to the target nodes along with their respective cost values.
